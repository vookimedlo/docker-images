![Docker Image CI](https://github.com/vookimedlo/docker-images/workflows/Docker%20Image%20CI/badge.svg)

Docker images for a continuous integration. CI services usually support the pre-defined GNU/Linux OS as a target platform. Docker images can bypass such restrictions.

The main purpose of these docker images is to provide the developer-ready platforms with the various [Qt][4] versions inside.

CI services:
- Travis-CI ([see example][3])
- Github Actions (see example)

Images are hosted at:
 - [GitHub Packages][2]
 - [Docker Hub][1]
