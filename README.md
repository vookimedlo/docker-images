Docker images for a continuous integration. CI services usually support the pre-defined GNU/Linux OS as a target platform. Docker images can bypass such restrictions.

The main purpose of these docker images is to provide the developer-ready platforms with the various [Qt][4] versions inside.

CI services:
- Travis-CI ([see example][3])
- Github Actions

Images are hosted at:
 - [Docker Hub][1] - built for multiple architectures
 - [GitHub Packages][2] - built for AMD64 architecture only
